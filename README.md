Problem Description
The Tourist Problem aims to find the quickest itinerary between cities, given a transportation
network consisting of bus and train stations. Each city may have one or both types of stations.
Each direct connection between stations has an associated travel time. In addition, some cities
allow transfers between bus and train stations, also with a specified transfer time.
Given a departure station, the goal is to compute the minimal total travel time to reach every city,
considering both direct connections and possible transfers between modes within cities.
